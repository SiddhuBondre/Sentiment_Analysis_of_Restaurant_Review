# 🍽️ Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews
## 📌 Project Overview

The Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews project aims to analyze customer feedback and classify their sentiments as positive or negative. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this project helps restaurants understand customer opinions, improve service quality, and make data-driven business decisions.

# 🎯 Objectives

✅ Preprocess and clean textual restaurant reviews.

✅ Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

✅ Convert text into numerical form using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.

✅ Build and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification.

✅ Provide insights into customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction trends.

# 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

## Programming Language: Python 🐍

## Libraries Used:

Data Preprocessing → Pandas, NumPy, re

NLP → NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn

Machine Learning → Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost

Deep Learning (Optional) → TensorFlow/Keras, LSTM, BERT

Visualization → Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

# 🔑 Methodology

Data Collection → Gather restaurant review dataset.

Data Cleaning → Remove punctuation, special characters, and lowercase text.

Text Preprocessing → Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Extraction → BoW / TF-IDF / Word2Vec / GloVe embeddings.

Model Building → Train ML/DL models for sentiment classification.

Evaluation → Use Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for performance.

Visualization → Word clouds, sentiment distribution plots, confusion matrix.

# 📊 Expected Results

A robust model that predicts whether a restaurant review is positive or negative.

Accuracy can range from 70% – 85% depending on preprocessing and model selection.

Visualization of most frequent positive & negative words.

# 🚀 Applications

🏨 Restaurant owners can monitor customer satisfaction.

📱 Food delivery platforms can highlight genuine positive/negative feedback.

🤖 Chatbots can classify sentiment of customer messages in real-time.

📈 Business decision-making through insights into customer preferences.

# 📌 Future Enhancements

Implement Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (e.g., food quality, service, ambience).

Use Deep Learning (LSTM, GRU, BERT) for higher accuracy.

Deploy as a Web App using Flask/Django or as a Dashboard using Streamlit.

Real-time sentiment tracking from social media reviews.
