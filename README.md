# 🍽️ Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews
## 📌 Project Overview

The Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews project aims to analyze customer feedback and classify their sentiments as positive or negative. By leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this project helps restaurants understand customer opinions, improve service quality, and make data-driven business decisions.

# 🎯 Objectives

✅ Preprocess and clean textual restaurant reviews.

✅ Apply NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

✅ Convert text into numerical form using Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings.

✅ Build and evaluate machine learning models for sentiment classification.

✅ Provide insights into customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction trends.
